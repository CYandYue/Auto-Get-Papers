These tasks encompass statistical inference problems such as parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, or mutual information estimation. Framing these tasks within traditional machine learning pipelines is challenging, as supervision is typically tied to individual datapoint. We propose meta-statistical learning, a framework inspired by multi-instance learning that reformulates statistical inference tasks as supervised learning problems. In this approach, entire datasets are treated as single inputs to neural networks, which predict distribution-level parameters. Transformer-based architectures, without positional encoding, provide a natural fit due to their permutation-invariance properties. By training on large-scale synthetic datasets, meta-statistical models can leverage the scalability and optimization infrastructure of Transformer-based LLMs. We demonstrate the framework's versatility with applications in hypothesis testing and mutual information estimation, showing strong performance, particularly for small datasets where traditional neural methods struggle."

However, using names as a core indicator of identity can lead to over-simplification of complex identities. When interacting with LLMs, user names are an important point of information for personalisation. Names can enter chatbot conversations through direct user input (requested by chatbots), as part of task contexts such as CV reviews, or as built-in memory features that store user information for personalisation. We study biases associated with names by measuring cultural presumptions in the responses generated by LLMs when presented with common suggestion-seeking queries, which might involve making assumptions about the user. Our analyses demonstrate strong assumptions about cultural identity associated with names present in LLM generations across multiple cultures. Our work has implications for designing more nuanced personalisation systems that avoid reinforcing stereotypes while maintaining meaningful customisation."

    "summary": "We investigate gravitational lensing near a charged black hole with a global monopole in the strong field regime, focusing on two key observables: the angular separation between the first and subsequent images, and the ratio of the flux intensity of the first image to the cumulative flux intensity of all other images. By deriving analytical expressions for these observables, we explore the combined effects of the global monopole and black hole charge both analytically and numerically. Our results reveal that the dependence of the angular separation on charge is intricately tied to the deficit angle caused by the global monopole. In particular, we identify three critical values of the global monopole parameter that determine whether the angular separation increases monotonically, decreases monotonically, or exhibits extrema as the charge varies. A similar complex dependence is found for the flux ratio as a function of the deficit angle. These behaviors contrast sharply with the monotonic changes observed in the absence of either a global monopole or charge. Our findings highlight that the effects of the charge and global monopole on gravitational lensing cannot be described as simple additive contributions. Instead, their combined effects lead to a rich and interdependent behavior that enhances our understanding of strong-field gravitational lensing. While the charge and global monopole are expected to be small in typical astrophysical contexts, the results presented here could be experimentally explored in analogue gravity systems, where these parameters are not constrained. This opens the door to potential experimental verification of the phenomena predicted in this study."

An emerging line of work explored parallel decoding by identifying and simultaneously generating semantically independent chunks of LLM responses. However, these techniques rely on hand-crafted heuristics tied to syntactic structures like lists and paragraphs, making them rigid and imprecise. We present PASTA, a learning-based system that teaches LLMs to identify semantic independence and express parallel decoding opportunities in their own responses. At its core are PASTA-LANG and its interpreter: PASTA-LANG is an annotation language that enables LLMs to express semantic independence in their own responses; the language interpreter acts on these annotations to orchestrate parallel decoding on-the-fly at inference time. Through a two-stage finetuning process, we train LLMs to generate PASTA-LANG annotations that optimize both response quality and decoding speed. Evaluation on AlpacaEval, an instruction following benchmark, shows that our approach Pareto-dominates existing methods in terms of decoding speed and response quality; our results demonstrate geometric mean speedups ranging from 1.21x to 1.93x with corresponding quality changes of +2.2% to -7.1%, measured by length-controlled win rates against sequential decoding baseline."

    "summary": "A conceptual space represents concepts as nodes and semantic relatedness as edges. Word embeddings, combined with a similarity metric, provide an effective approach to constructing such a space. Typically, embeddings are derived from traditional distributed models or encoder-only pretrained models, whose objectives directly capture the meaning of the current token. In contrast, decoder-only models, including large language models (LLMs), predict the next token, making their embeddings less directly tied to the current token's semantics. Moreover, comparative studies on LLMs of different scales remain underexplored. In this paper, we construct a conceptual space using word embeddings from LLMs of varying scales and comparatively analyze their properties. We establish a network based on a linguistic typology-inspired connectivity hypothesis, examine global statistical properties, and compare LLMs of varying scales. Locally, we analyze conceptual pairs, WordNet relations, and a cross-lingual semantic network for qualitative words. Our results indicate that the constructed space exhibits small-world properties, characterized by a high clustering coefficient and short path lengths. Larger LLMs generate more intricate spaces, with longer paths reflecting richer relational structures and connections. Furthermore, the network serves as an efficient bridge for cross-lingual semantic mapping."

However, designing a pair of PnCs with specified band gaps (BGs) and TIS frequency remains a challenging problem. In this work, deep learning (DL) approaches are used for the engineering of one-dimensional (1D) PnCs with high design freedoms. The considered 1D PnCs are composed of periodic solid scatterers embedded in the air background, whose unit cell is divided into a matrix with 32 * 32 pixels. First, the variational autoencoder is applied to reduce the dimensionality of unit cell images, allowing accurate reconstruction of PnC images with different numbers of scatterers. Subsequently, the multilayer perceptron and the tandem neural network are used to realize the property prediction and customized design of 1D PnCs, respectively. The correlation coefficients for the property prediction and inverse design are more than 97%. The unit cell images of 1D PnCs with specific BG properties could be successfully and instantaneously designed. Importantly, the implementation of a \"one-to-many\" design of PnC pairs with specific TIS frequencies is realized. Furthermore, the reliability and robustness of the constructed networks are confirmed by randomly specifying the design targets as well as the experimental verification. This study demonstrates the broad application prospects of DL approaches in the field of PnC design and provides new ideas and methods for the intelligent design of artificially functional materials."

Despite their versatile properties, superconductivity has never been demonstrated, not even predicted, for this important group of 2D materials. In this work, we have introduced an electrochemical intercalation protocol to construct versatile organometallic-inorganic hybrid MXenes and achieved tunable superconductivity in the metallocene-modified layered crystals. Through structural editing of MXene matrix at atomic scale and meticulously modulated intercalation route, Ti3C2Tx intercalated with metallocene species exhibits a superconductive transition temperature (Tc) of 10.2 K. Guest intercalation induced electron filling and strain engineering are responsible for the emerging superconductivity in this intrinsically non-superconducting material. Theoretically, simulated electron-phonon interaction effects further elucidate the nature of the changes in Tc. Furthermore, the Tc of crafted artificial superlattices beyond Ti-based MXenes have been predicted, offering a general strategy for engineering superconductivity and magnetism in layered hybrid materials."

    "summary": "Collaborative perception is essential for networks of agents with limited sensing capabilities, enabling them to work together by exchanging information to achieve a robust and comprehensive understanding of their environment. However, localization inaccuracies often lead to significant spatial message displacement, which undermines the effectiveness of these collaborative efforts. To tackle this challenge, we introduce FeaKM, a novel method that employs Feature-level Keypoints Matching to effectively correct pose discrepancies among collaborating agents. Our approach begins by utilizing a confidence map to identify and extract salient points from intermediate feature representations, allowing for the computation of their descriptors. This step ensures that the system can focus on the most relevant information, enhancing the matching process. We then implement a target-matching strategy that generates an assignment matrix, correlating the keypoints identified by different agents. This is critical for establishing accurate correspondences, which are essential for effective collaboration. Finally, we employ a fine-grained transformation matrix to synchronize the features of all agents and ascertain their relative statuses, ensuring coherent communication among them. Our experimental results demonstrate that FeaKM significantly outperforms existing methods on the DAIR-V2X dataset, confirming its robustness even under severe noise conditions. The code and implementation details are available at https://github.com/uestchjw/FeaKM."

Here we reveal that one can suppress that unwanted backscattering and dissipation in magnetic TIs using high-frequency linearly polarized light (LPL). By carefully considering the hexagonal warping of the Fermi surface of the TI, we demonstrate how the coupling between Dirac surface states and LPL can effectively reduce backscattering on magnetic dopants, enhance carrier mobility and suppress resistance, even entirely. These findings open up avenues for designing ultra low-power sensing and spintronic technology."

We address this challenge by proposing ORI (O Routing Intelligence), a dynamic framework that leverages a set of LLMs. By intelligently routing incoming queries to the most suitable model, ORI not only improves task-specific accuracy, but also maintains efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate consistent accuracy gains while controlling computational overhead. By intelligently routing queries, ORI outperforms the strongest individual models by up to 2.7 points on MMLU and 1.8 points on MuSR, ties the top performance on ARC, and on BBH. These results underscore the benefits of a multi-model strategy and demonstrate how ORI's adaptive architecture can more effectively handle diverse tasks, offering a scalable, high-performance solution for a system of multiple large language models."

We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through a forward data masking process and a reverse process, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer to predict masked tokens. By optimizing a likelihood bound, it provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive benchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task. Our findings establish diffusion models as a viable and promising alternative to ARMs, challenging the assumption that key LLM capabilities discussed above are inherently tied to ARMs."

Even if the Ti content is constant into Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3${}, its ionic yield exhibits an increasing trend as Ba is substituted by Sr. Such a phenomenon can be explained by the variation of the neighbouring atoms chemistry which affects the ionization probability of titanium during the sputtering process. In addition to the continuously varying composition, the oxide multilayer sample features sharp interfaces hence the in-depth resolution under our analysing conditions has been investigated too. The modelling of the interface crossing profiles reveals that the instrumental contribution to the profile broadening is as low as 5 nm."

    "summary": "Choice correspondences are crucial in decision-making, especially when faced with indifferences or ties. While tie-breaking can transform a choice correspondence into a choice function, it often introduces inefficiencies. This paper introduces a novel notion of path-independence (PI) for choice correspondences, extending the existing concept of PI for choice functions. Intuitively, a choice correspondence is PI if any consistent tie-breaking produces a PI choice function. This new notion yields several important properties. First, PI choice correspondences are rationalizabile, meaning they can be represented as the maximization of a utility function. This extends a core feature of PI in choice functions. Second, we demonstrate that the set of choices selected by a PI choice correspondence for any subset forms a generalized matroid. This property reveals that PI choice correspondences exhibit a nice structural property. Third, we establish that choice correspondences rationalized by ordinally concave functions inherently satisfy the PI condition. This aligns with recent findings that a choice function satisfies PI if and only if it can be rationalized by an ordinally concave function. Building on these theoretical foundations, we explore stable and efficient matchings under PI choice correspondences. Specifically, we investigate constrained efficient matchings, which are efficient (for one side of the market) within the set of stable matchings. Under responsive choice correspondences, such matchings are characterized by cycles. However, this cycle-based characterization fails in more general settings. We demonstrate that when the choice correspondence of each school satisfies both PI and monotonicity conditions, a similar cycle-based characterization is restored. These findings provide new insights into the matching theory and its practical applications."

In that context, the dimension of the vectors is intimately tied to the size of the input structure to be verified. In this work, we formally analyze the complexity of classical list-based algorithms to manipulate antichains as well as that of Zampuni\\'eris's sharing trees and traditional and novel kdtree-based antichain algorithms. In contrast to the existing literature, and to better address the needs of formal verification, our analysis of \\kdtree algorithms does not assume that the dimension of the vectors is fixed. Our theoretical results show that kdtrees are asymptotically better than both list- and sharing-tree-based algorithms, as an antichain data structure, when the antichains become exponentially larger than the dimension of the vectors. We evaluate this on applications in the synthesis of reactive systems from linear-temporal logic and parity-objective specifications, and establish empirically that current benchmarks for these computational tasks do not lead to a favorable situation for current implementations of kdtrees."

    "summary": "Generating logical qubits, essential for error detection and correction in quantum computation, remains a critical challenge in continuous-variable (CV) optical quantum information processing. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is a leading candidate for logical qubits, and its generation requires large-amplitude coherent state superpositions -- Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states. However, experimentally producing these resource states has been hindered in the optical domain by technical challenges. The photon subtraction method, a standard approach for generating cat states using a squeezed vacuum and a photon number-resolving detector, has proven difficult to scale to multi-photon operations. While the amplitude of the generated cat states increases with the number of subtracted photons, limitations in the generation rate have restricted the maximum photon subtraction to $n=3$ for over a decade. In this work, we demonstrate high-rate photon subtraction of up to four photons from a squeezed vacuum with picosecond wavepackets generated by a broadband optical parametric amplifier. Using a Ti-Au superconducting-transition-edge sensor, we achieve high-speed, high-resolution photon number discrimination. The resulting states exhibit Wigner function negativity without loss correction, and their quantum coherence is verified through off-diagonal density matrix elements in CV representation. These results overcome long-standing limitations in multi-photon operations, providing a critical foundation for generating quantum resources essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing and advancing ultrafast optical quantum processors."

    "summary": "Bipartite networks provide a major insight into the organisation of many real-world systems, describing the mechanisms that drive interactions between distinct groups of nodes. Of particular interest are two-mode networks whose edges admit a sign: examples are provided by human interactions with entities such as products, where agents either cast either a positive or negative vote or abstain from voting at all. One of the most relevant issues encountered when modelling a bipartite network is devising a way to obtain a monopartite projection onto the layer of interest that preserves the information encoded into the original structure as much as possible. In the present contribution, we propose an unsupervised algorithm to obtain statistically validated projections of bipartite signed networks, according to which any two nodes sharing a statistically significant number of concordant (discordant) relationships are connected by a positive (negative) edge. More precisely, we propose two variants of it, according to the way ambivalent patterns and missing ties are treated. Since assessing the statistical significance of any two nodes similarity requires a proper benchmark, here we consider four different Exponential Random Graphs, defined by global as well as local constraints, either leaving the topology free or keeping the topology fixed. Our algorithm outputs a matrix of link-specific $p-$values, from which a validated projection can be obtained upon running a multiple-hypothesis testing procedure. After testing our method on synthetic configurations output by a fully controllable generative model, we apply it to several real-world configurations: in all cases, non-trivial mesoscopic structures, induced by relationships that cannot be traced back to the constraints defining the employed benchmarks, are detected."

Measuring the current-phase relation (CPR) in JJ based on topological insulators (TI) can provide critical insights into unconventional phenomena in these systems, such as the presence of Majorana bound states (MBS) and the nature of non-reciprocal transport. However, reconstructing CPR as a function of magnetic field in such JJs has remained experimentally challenging. Here, we introduce a platform for precise CPR measurements in planar JJs composed of NbSe$_2$ and few layer thick Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (TI) as a function of magnetic field. When a single flux quantum $\\Phi_\\mathrm{0}$ threads the junction, we observe anomalous peak-dip-shaped CPR behaviour and non-reciprocal supercurrent flow. We demonstrate that these anomalies stem from the edge-amplified sloped supercurrent profile rather than MBS signatures often invoked to explain puzzles emerging near $\\Phi_\\mathrm{0}$ in TI-based JJ. Furthermore, we show that such a supercurrent profile gives rise to a previously overlooked, robust and tunable Josephson diode effect. These findings establish field-dependent CPR measurements as a critical tool for exploring topological superconducting devices and offer new design principles for non-reciprocal superconducting electronics."

    "summary": "Neutron reflectivity is a powerful technique for probing density profiles in films, with applications across Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. However, challenges arise when dealing with samples characterized by high roughness, unknown scattering length density (SLD) with low contrast, very thin layers, or complex multi-layered structures, that cannot be uniquely resolved due to the phase problem. Incorporating a magnetic reference layer (MRL) and using polarized neutron reflectivity improves sensitivity and modeling accuracy by providing complementary information. In this study, we introduce a quantitative way to compare MRL systems in a model-free way. We apply this approach to demonstrate that CoTi alloys offer a superior solution as an MRL compared to the commonly used Fe or Ni-based MRLs. The low nuclear and magnetic scattering length densities of CoTi significantly enhance sensitivity, making it particularly advantageous for soft matter research. Furthermore, the tunable Co vs Ti ratio allows for optimization of the SLDs to achieve maximum sensitivity, establishing CoTi as a highly effective choice for MRL applications. The applied simulation framework for optimizing MRL sensitivity to a specific materials system and research question is a generic approach that can be used prior to growing the MRL for a given experiment."

The study shows that the use and organisation of pitch in the company's `Primaal' brand differs from Western classical music. Through interviews with producers and in-depth analysis of their work, we reveal that their methods centre on a conscious aim to construct a musical discourse based on pitch uncertainty, contrasting with the clear transmission of well-defined pitches in Western classical traditions. According to the Primaal producers, who acknowledge the influence of artists such as Kanye West and Daft Punk and use widely available technology, pitch uncertainty captures the listener's attention. We provide analyses of musical excerpts demonstrating their approach, alongside descriptions of the tools and methods employed to achieve their expressive goals. These goals and methods are placed in a broader historical context, contrasting with fundamental principles of pitch organisation in Western music. Techniques used by Hyper Music to introduce and control pitch uncertainty include boosting upper partials, expressive use of inharmonicity, continuous pitch distributions around 'poles' tied to specific 'modes', and continuously evolving pitch. We examine these techniques from a psychoacoustic perspective, and conduct listening tests corroborating some of the observations. The ultimate goal of the study is to introduce a set of methods suited to the analysis of pitch in contemporary popular music."

Recently, layered oxides emerged as highly tunable semiconductors.

Here, we demonstrate local acceptor and donor doping in Er(Mn,Ti)O$_3$, facilitated by the splitting of such anti-Frenkel defects under applied d.c. voltage. By combining density functional theory calculations, scanning probe microscopy, atom probe tomography, and scanning transmission electron microscopy, we show that the oxygen defects readily move through the layered crystal structure, leading to nano-sized interstitial-rich (p-type) and vacancy-rich (n-type) regions. The resulting pattern is comparable to dipolar npn-junctions and stable on the timescale of days. Our findings reveal the possibility of temporarily functionalizing oxide semiconductors at the nanoscale, giving additional opportunities for the field of oxide electronics and the development of transient electronics in general."

Recently, this fundamental concept has been generalized in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs). E.g., a second-order three-dimensional (3D) TI hosts one-dimensional (1D) topological hinge states winding around the crystal. However, a complete verification of higher-order topology is still lacking as it requires probing all the crystal boundaries. Here we studied a promising candidate of second-order TI, bismuth (Bi), in the form of mesoscopic crystals grown on superconducting V3Si. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we directly observed dispersive 1D states on various hinges of the crystal. Upon introducing magnetic scatterers, new scattering channels emerged selectively on certain hinges, revealing their spin-helical nature. Combining first-principle calculation and global symmetry analysis, we find these hinge states are topological and formed a closed loop encircling the crystal. This provides direct evidence on the higher-order topology in Bi. Moreover, proximity superconductivity is observed in the topological hinge states, enabling HOTI as a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana quasiparticles."

Here, we report the discovery of ternary germanide superconductors, $M$IrGe ($M$ = Ti, Hf), as prime candidates for topological superconductivity, predicted to exhibit nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected hourglass Dirac chains. Using comprehensive thermodynamic and muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\\mu$SR) measurements, we establish these materials as conventional bulk type-II superconductors with transition temperatures of 2.24(5) K for TiIrGe and 5.64(4) K for HfIrGe, featuring a full gap and preserved time-reversal symmetry. First-principles calculations reveal striking topological features in $M$IrGe, including hourglass-shaped bulk dispersions and a Dirac chain- a ring of fourfold-degenerate Dirac points protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry. Each Dirac point corresponds to the neck of the hourglass dispersion, while the Dirac chain gives rise to drumhead-like surface states near the Fermi level. Additionally, nontrivial $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology leads to isolated Dirac surface states with helical spin textures that disperse across the Fermi level, forming an ideal platform for proximity-induced topological superconductivity. The coexistence of conventional bulk superconductivity, symmetry-protected hourglass topology, and helical spin-textured surface states establishes $M$IrGe as a rare and robust platform to realize topological superconductivity, opening new avenues for next-generation quantum technologies."

This is due to the internal access insiders have to systems, information, and infrastructure. %One example of this influence is where anonymous respondents submit web-based job search site reviews, an insider threat risk to organizations. Signals for such risks may be found in anonymous submissions to public web-based job search site reviews. This research studies the potential for large language models (LLMs) to analyze and detect insider threat sentiment within job site reviews. Addressing ethical data collection concerns, this research utilizes synthetic data generation using LLMs alongside existing job review datasets. A comparative analysis of sentiment scores generated by LLMs is benchmarked against expert human scoring. Findings reveal that LLMs demonstrate alignment with human evaluations in most cases, thus effectively identifying nuanced indicators of threat sentiment. The performance is lower on human-generated data than synthetic data, suggesting areas for improvement in evaluating real-world data. Text diversity analysis found differences between human-generated and LLM-generated datasets, with synthetic data exhibiting somewhat lower diversity. Overall, the results demonstrate the applicability of LLMs to insider threat detection, and a scalable solution for insider sentiment testing by overcoming ethical and logistical barriers tied to data acquisition."

In this paper, we observe that models trained with empirical risk minimization tend to generalize well for examples from the majority groups while memorizing instances from minority groups. Building on recent findings that show memorization can be localized to a limited number of neurons, we apply example-tied dropout as a method we term FairDropout, aimed at redirecting this memorization to specific neurons that we subsequently drop out during inference. We empirically evaluate FairDropout using the subpopulation benchmark suite encompassing vision, language, and healthcare tasks, demonstrating that it significantly reduces reliance on spurious correlations, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

However, given the complex cyber-physical nature of power grids, it is hard to respond timely with limited costs for deploying additional cyber and/or phyiscal resources, such as during a high-impact low-frequency cyber-physical event. Therefore, the paper examines the design of cooperative cyber-physical resource optimization solutions to control grid-tied cyber and physical resources. First, the operation of a cyber-physical power system is formulated into a constrained optimization problem, including the cyber and physical objectives and constraints. Then, a bi-level solution is provided to obtain optimal cyber and physical actions, including the reconfiguration of cyber topology (e.g., activation of communication links) in the cyber layer and the control of physical resources (e.g., energy storage systems) in the physical layer. The developed method improves grid resilience during cyberattacks and can provide guidance on the control of coupled physical side resources. Numerical simulation on a modified IEEE 14-bus system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "summary": "This paper presents a novel approach to efficiently parameterize and estimate the state of a hanging tether for path and trajectory planning of a UGV tied to a UAV in a marsupial configuration. Most implementations in the state of the art assume a taut tether or make use of the catenary curve to model the shape of the hanging tether. The catenary model is complex to compute and must be instantiated thousands of times during the planning process, becoming a time-consuming task, while the taut tether assumption simplifies the problem, but might overly restrict the movement of the platforms. In order to accelerate the planning process, this paper proposes defining an analytical model to efficiently compute the hanging tether state, and a method to get a tether state parameterization free of collisions. We exploit the existing similarity between the catenary and parabola curves to derive analytical expressions of the tether state."

    "summary": "The GPT-4 technical report from OpenAI suggests that model performance on specific tasks can be predicted prior to training, though methodologies remain unspecified. This approach is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and ensuring data alignment with target tasks. To achieve this vision, we focus on predicting performance on Closed-book Question Answering (CBQA) tasks, which are closely tied to pre-training data and knowledge retention. We address three major challenges: 1) mastering the entire pre-training process, especially data construction; 2) evaluating a model's knowledge retention; and 3) predicting task-specific knowledge retention using only information available prior to training. To tackle these challenges, we pre-train three large language models (i.e., 1.6B, 7B, and 13B) using 560k dollars and 520k GPU hours. We analyze the pre-training data with knowledge triples and assess knowledge retention using established methods. Additionally, we introduce the SMI metric, an information-theoretic measure that quantifies the relationship between pre-training data, model size, and task-specific knowledge retention. Our experiments reveal a strong linear correlation ($\\text{R}^2 > 0.84$) between the SMI metric and the model's accuracy on CBQA tasks across models of varying sizes (i.e., 1.1B, 1.6B, 7B, and 13B).

These learners leverage, respectively, a clever deterministic subsampling scheme and the classic heuristic of bagging Breiman [1996]. Both optimal PAC learners use, as a subroutine, the natural algorithm of empirical risk minimization. Consequently, the computational cost of these optimal PAC learners is tied to that of the empirical risk minimizer algorithm. In this work, we seek to provide an alternative perspective on the computational cost imposed by the link to the empirical risk minimizer algorithm. To this end, we show the existence of an optimal PAC learner, which offers a different tradeoff in terms of the computational cost induced by the empirical risk minimizer."

However, the properties of the latent space from tokenizer for better learning and generation of diffusion models remain under-explored. Theoretically and empirically, we find that improved generation quality is closely tied to the latent distributions with better structure, such as the ones with fewer Gaussian Mixture modes and more discriminative features. Motivated by these insights, we propose MAETok, an autoencoder (AE) leveraging mask modeling to learn semantically rich latent space while maintaining reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments validate our analysis, demonstrating that the variational form of autoencoders is not necessary, and a discriminative latent space from AE alone enables state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet generation using only 128 tokens. MAETok achieves significant practical improvements, enabling a gFID of 1.69 with 76x faster training and 31x higher inference throughput for 512x512 generation. Our findings show that the structure of the latent space, rather than variational constraints, is crucial for effective diffusion models. Code and trained models are released."

In conventional perturbative approaches, energy conservation during each microscopic phonon interaction is enforced using delta functions. We demonstrate that these delta functions stem from an incomplete treatment, that violates the fluctuation-dissipation theorem governing systems at equilibrium. By replacing delta functions with convolutions and introducing a self-consistency condition for the phonon spectral function, we provide a more accurate and physically consistent framework. For systems where phonon dynamics can be approximated as Markovian, we simplify this approach, reducing the dissipative component to a single parameter tied to phonon lifetimes. Applying this method to boron arsenide, we find that self-consistent linewidths better capture the phonon scattering processes, significantly improving agreement with experimental thermal conductivity values. These results also challenge the conventional view of four-phonon processes as dominant in BAs, demonstrating the adequacy of a three-phonon description, provided it is self-consistent. With this method we address critical limitations of perturbative approaches, offering new insights into dissipation and phonon-mediated processes, and enabling more accurate modeling of anharmonic materials."

By using our new approach based on total content of late transition metal(s), we derive a number of physical parameters of a hypothetical amorphous TiZrNb alloy: lattice parameter $a = (3.42 \\pm 0.02)$\\r{A}, Sommerfeld coefficient $\\gamma = 6.2\\,$mJ/mol$\\,$K$^2$, density of states at $N(E_F) = 2.6\\,(\\text{at eV})^{-1}$, magnetic susceptibility $(2.00 \\pm 0.05)\\,$mJ/T$^2\\,$mol, superconducting transition temperature $T_c = (8 \\pm 1)\\,$K, upper critical field $\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) = (20 \\pm 5)\\,$T, and coherence length $\\xi(0) = (40 \\pm 3)\\,$\\r{A}. We show that our extrapolated results for amorphous TiZrNb alloy would be similar to that of crystalline TiZrNb, except for superconducting properties (most notably the upper critical field $H_{c2}(0)$), which might be attributed to the strong topological disorder of the amorphous phase. Also, we offer an explanation of the discrepancy between the variations of $T_c$ with the average number of valency electrons in neighboring alloys of 4d transition metals and some high entropy alloys. Overall, we find that our novel method of systematic analysis of results is rather general, as it can provide reliable estimates of the properties of any alloy which has not been prepared as yet."

We image in real time and simultaneously the lattice parameter and crystal orientation of the dense LiCoO2 cathode, the Ti current collector and the electrodeposited Li metal anode. We reveal that reaction mechanism of LiCoO2 depends on the crystal orientation, and that, in dense electrodes as opposed to porous ones, the delithiation is limited by the formation of a Li-rich insulating interface. Li metal crystal orientation is found to be influenced initially by the Ti texture and to change within minutes during plating and stripping. These results demonstrate the power of X-ray imaging to link reaction mechanism and grain orientation during non-equilibrium processes."

Recently, hypergraphs have emerged as a versatile tool to model networks with non-dyadic, higher-order interactions. Nevertheless, the connectivity properties of real-world hypergraphs remain largely understudied. In this work we introduce path size as a measure to characterise higher-order connectivity and quantify the relevance of non-dyadic ties for efficient shortest paths in a diverse set of empirical networks with and without temporal information. By comparing our results with simple randomised null models, our analysis presents a nuanced picture, suggesting that non-dyadic ties are often central and are vital for system connectivity, while dyadic edges remain essential to connect more peripheral nodes, an effect which is particularly pronounced for time-varying systems. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the structural organisation of systems with higher-order interactions."

Chemical doping of the kagome plane can simultaneously tune the exotic states and the Fermi-surface orbital texture, and thus offers a unique opportunity to correlate the given states with specific orbitals. In this Letter, by substituting V atoms with Ti in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, we reveal the orbital origin of a cascade of its correlated electronic states through the orbital-resolved quasiparticle interference (QPI). We analyze the QPI changes associated with different orbitals, aided by first-principles calculations. We have observed that the in-plane and out-of-plane vanadium 3d orbitals cooperate to form unidirectional coherent states in pristine CsV3Sb5, whereas the out-of-plane component disappears with doping-induced suppression of charge density wave and global electronic nematicity. In addition, the Sb pz orbital plays an important role in both the pseudo-gap and superconducting states in CsV3Sb5. Our findings offer new insights into multiorbital physics in quantum materials which are generally manifested with intriguing correlations between atomic orbitals and symmetry-encoded correlated electronic states."

In quantum paralelectric SrTiO3, strain can induce the ferroelectric transition via modification of local Ti potential landscape. However, brittle bulk materials can only withstand limited strain range (~0.1%). Taking advantage of nanoscopically-thin freestanding membranes, we demonstrated in-situ strain-induced reversible ferroelectric transition in a single freestanding SrTiO3 membranes. We measure the ferroelectric order by detecting the local anisotropy of the Ti 3d orbital using X-ray linear dichroism at the Ti-K pre-edge, while the strain is determined by X-ray diffraction. With reduced thickness, the SrTiO3 membranes remain elastic with >1% tensile strain cycles. A robust displacive ferroelectricity appears beyond a temperature-dependent critical strain. Interestingly, we discover a crossover from a classical ferroelectric transition to a quantum regime at low temperatures, which enhances strain-induced ferroelectricity. Our results offer a new opportunities to strain engineer functional properties in low dimensional quantum materials and provide new insights into the role of the ferroelectric fluctuations in quantum paraelectric SrTiO3."

In this study, we exemplify the strain-engineered magnetism of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ in freestanding and rippled membrane forms without and with process-induced strain, respectively, prepared by epitaxial lift-off technique. We find that the deposition of Pt/Ti stressor suppresses the crack formation in the lift-off process and induces a ripple structure in the La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane. Laser micrograph and Raman spectroscopy show a ripple period of about 30 um and a height of a few um, where alternating convex and concave structures are subjected to tensile strain of 0.6% and compressive strain of 0.5%, respectively. While the freestanding La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism, the macroscopic magnetic transition temperature (TC) of the rippled membrane is reduced by as large as 27%. Temperature-variable Kerr microscopy observation in the rippled membrane reveals that the spatial variation of TC to be approximately 4% of the macroscopic TC, which coincides with the local strains at convex and concave structures. The large reduction of macroscopic TC in the rippled membrane may be ascribed to the lattice disorders due to strain gradient. Our demonstration of tuning ferromagnetism by the ripple structure validates the high potential of the process-induced strain in epitaxial lift-off technique and paves the way for strain-mediated emerging physical properties in various transition metal oxides."

Where prior work has focused on unsigned networks, we investigate the need to consider negative ties in networks while trying to maximise spread in a population - particularly under competitive conditions. Given a signed network we optimise the strategies of a focal controller, against competing influence in the network, using two approaches - either the focal controller uses a sign-agnostic approach or they factor in the sign of the edges while optimising their strategy. We compare the difference in vote-shares (or the share of population) obtained by both these methods to determine the need to navigate negative ties in these settings. More specifically, we study the impact of: (a) network topology, (b) resource conditions and (c) competitor strategies on the difference in vote shares obtained across both methodologies. We observe that gains are maximum when resources available to the focal controller are low and the competitor avoids negative edges in their strategy. Conversely, gains are insignificant irrespective of resource conditions when the competitor targets the network indiscriminately. Finally, we study the problem in a game-theoretic setting, where we simultaneously optimise the strategies of both competitors. Interestingly we observe that, strategising with the knowledge of negative ties can occasionally also lead to loss in vote-shares."

The first contribution of this work is the use of a difference-in-differences analysis of $99$ companies to measure the causal impact of ESMPs on companies' communication networks across the full spectrum of communication technologies used within companies: email, instant messaging, and ESMPs. Adoption caused companies' communication networks to grow denser and more well-connected by adding new, novel ties that often, but not exclusively, involve communication from one to many employees. Importantly, some new ties also bridge otherwise separate parts of the corporate communication network. The second contribution of this work, utilizing data on Microsoft's own communication network, is understanding how these communication technologies connect people across the corporate hierarchy. Compared to email and instant messaging, ESMPs excel at connecting nodes distant in the corporate hierarchy both vertically (between leaders and employees) and horizontally (between employees in similar roles but different sectors). Also, influence in ESMPs is more `democratic' than elsewhere, with high-influence nodes well-distributed across the corporate hierarchy. Overall, our results suggest that ESMPs boost information flow within companies and increase employees' attention to what is happening outside their immediate working group, above and beyond email and instant messaging."

In the context of Bayesian-optimal learning, in the limit of large dimension $D$ and commensurably large number of samples $N$, we derive a sharp asymptotic characterization of the optimal performance as well as the performance of the best-known polynomial-time algorithm for this setting --namely approximate message-passing--, and characterize sharp thresholds on the minimal sample complexity required for better-than-random prediction performance.

Smoothing holds the key for easing the problem of learning and sampling in high dimensions, denoising is needed for recovering the original signal, and TMF ties these together via the score function of noisy data. In this work, we extend this paradigm to the problem of learning and sampling the distribution of binary data on the Boolean hypercube by adopting Bernoulli noise, instead of Gaussian noise, as a smoothing device. We first derive a TMF-like expression for the optimal denoiser for the Hamming loss, where a score function naturally appears. Sampling noisy binary data is then achieved using a Langevin-like sampler which we theoretically analyze for different noise levels. At high Bernoulli noise levels sampling becomes easy, akin to log-concave sampling in Euclidean spaces. In addition, we extend the sequential multi-measurement sampling of Saremi et al. (2024) to the binary setting where we can bring the \"effective noise\" down by sampling multiple noisy measurements at a fixed noise level, without the need for continuous-time stochastic processes. We validate our formalism and theoretical findings by experiments on synthetic data and binarized images."

    "summary": "In this paper an extensive database of SPARC H-modes confinement predictions has been provided, to assess its variability with respect to few input assumptions. The simulations have been performed within the ASTRA framework, using the quasi-linear model TGLF SAT2, including electromagnetic effects, for the core transport, and a neural network trained on EPED simulations to predict the pedestal height and width self-consistently. The database has been developed starting from two SPARC H-mode discharges (12.2 T, i.e. Primary Reference Discharge or PRD, and 8 T, i.e. reduced field) and permuting 4 input parameters (W concentration, DT mixture concentration, temperature ratio at top of pedestal and deviation of pedestal pressure from the EPED prediction), to perform a sensitivity study. For the PRD a scan of auxiliary input power (ion cyclotron heating) has been performed up to 25MW, to keep highly radiative plasmas above the LH power threshold as predicted by Martin and Schmidtmayr power scalings. A scan of pedestal density has then been performed for both PRD and 8T databases. ptop/pEPED and Ti/Te at top of pedestal showed the biggest impact on the fusion gain. Significant variation is observed across the database, highlighting the importance of sensitivity studies. Below a certain W concentration, the 12T database shows that Q > 5 is consistently achieved for full-field H-modes with 11 MW of auxiliary power, and values of Q > 2 are assured when increasing the input power to keep the plasma in H-mode. The 8T database demonstrates that SPARC can access a Q > 1 operational window with low W concentration, making it a potentially interesting scenario for obtaining breakeven conditions."

    "summary": "Brain-inspired computing architectures attempt to emulate the computations performed in the neurons and the synapses in human brain. Memristors with continuously tunable resistances are ideal building blocks for artificial synapses. Through investigating the memristor behaviors in a La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 multiferroic tunnel junction, it was found that the ferroelectric domain dynamics characteristics are influenced by the relative magnetization alignment of the electrodes, and the interfacial spin polarization is manipulated continuously by ferroelectric domain reversal, enriching our understanding of the magnetoelectric coupling fundamentally. This creates a functionality that not only the resistance of the memristor but also the synaptic plasticity form can be further manipulated, as demonstrated by the spike-timing-dependent plasticity investigations. Density functional theory calculations are carried out to describe the obtained magnetoelectric coupling, which is probably related to the Mn-Ti intermixing at the interfaces. The multiple and controllable plasticity characteristic in a single artificial synapse, to resemble the synaptic morphological alteration property in a biological synapse, will be conducive to the development of artificial intelligence."

    "summary": "We investigate the impact of limited data on training pairwise energy-based models for inverse problems aimed at identifying interaction networks. Utilizing the Gaussian model as testbed, we dissect training trajectories across the eigenbasis of the coupling matrix, exploiting the independent evolution of eigenmodes and revealing that the learning timescales are tied to the spectral decomposition of the empirical covariance matrix. We see that optimal points for early stopping arise from the interplay between these timescales and the initial conditions of training. Moreover, we show that finite data corrections can be accurately modeled through asymptotic random matrix theory calculations and provide the counterpart of generalized cross-validation in the energy based model context. Our analytical framework extends to binary-variable maximum-entropy pairwise models with minimal variations. These findings offer strategies to control overfitting in discrete-variable models through empirical shrinkage corrections, improving the management of overfitting in energy-based generative models."

    "summary": "Unsupervised learning of disentangled representations has been closely tied to enhancing the representation intepretability of Recommender Systems (RSs). This has been achieved by making the representation of individual features more distinctly separated, so that it is easier to attribute the contribution of features to the model's predictions. However, such advantages in interpretability and feature attribution have mainly been explored qualitatively. Moreover, the effect of disentanglement on the model's recommendation performance has been largely overlooked. In this work, we reproduce the recommendation performance, representation disentanglement and representation interpretability of five well-known recommendation models on four RS datasets. We quantify disentanglement and investigate the link of disentanglement with recommendation effectiveness and representation interpretability. While several existing work in RSs have proposed disentangled representations as a gateway to improved effectiveness and interpretability, our findings show that disentanglement is not necessarily related to effectiveness but is closely related to representation interpretability. Our code and results are publicly available at https://github.com/edervishaj/disentanglement-interpretability-recsys."

    "summary": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a critical role in galaxy evolution, influencing gas flows, feedback processes, and galactic dynamics. Observations show a substantial cold gas reservoir in the CGM, but the mechanisms driving its formation and evolution remain unclear. Cosmic rays (CRs), as a source of non-thermal pressure, are increasingly recognized as key regulators of cold gas dynamics. This study explores how CRs affect cold clouds that condense from the hot CGM via thermal instability (TI). Using 3D CR-magnetohydrodynamic (CRMHD) simulations with AREPO, we assess the impact of various CR transport models on cold gas evolution. Under purely advective CR transport, CR pressure significantly suppresses the collapse of thermally unstable regions, altering the CGM's structure. In contrast, realistic CR transport models reveal that CRs escape collapsing regions via streaming and diffusion along magnetic fields, diminishing their influence on the thermal and dynamic structure of the cold CGM. The ratio of the CR escape time to the cloud collapse time emerges as a critical factor in determining the impact of CRs on TI. CRs remain confined within cold clouds when effective CR diffusion is slow which maximizes their pressure support and inhibits collapse. Fast effective CR diffusion, as realized in our 2-moment CRMHD model, facilitates rapid CR escape, reducing their stabilizing effect. This realistic CR transport model shows a wide dynamic range of the effective CR diffusion coefficient, ranging from $10^{29}$ to $10^{30}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$ for thermally- to CR-dominated atmospheres, respectively. In addition to these CR transport-related effects, we demonstrate that high numerical resolution is crucial to avoid spuriously large clouds formed in low-resolution simulations, which would result in overly long CR escape times and artificially amplified CR pressure support."
