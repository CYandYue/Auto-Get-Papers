    "summary": "The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating VLMs is publicly available at: https://github.com/pascalbenschopTU/VLLM_AnomalyRecognition"

    "summary": "Subgraph matching is vital in knowledge graph (KG) question answering, molecule design, scene graph, code and circuit search, etc. Neural methods have shown promising results for subgraph matching. Our study of recent systems suggests refactoring them into a unified design space for graph matching networks. Existing methods occupy only a few isolated patches in this space, which remains largely uncharted. We undertake the first comprehensive exploration of this space, featuring such axes as attention-based vs. soft permutation-based interaction between query and corpus graphs, aligning nodes vs. edges, and the form of the final scoring network that integrates neural representations of the graphs. Our extensive experiments reveal that judicious and hitherto-unexplored combinations of choices in this space lead to large performance benefits. Beyond better performance, our study uncovers valuable insights and establishes general design principles for neural graph representation and interaction, which may be of wider interest."

    "summary": "Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network (GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments, and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/structlearning/isonetpp."

    "summary": "Autonomous landing in unstructured (cluttered, uneven, and map-poor) environments is a core requirement for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), yet purely vision-based or deep learning models often falter under covariate shift and provide limited interpretability. We propose NeuroSymLand, a neuro-symbolic framework that tightly couples two complementary pipelines: (i) an offline pipeline, where Large Language Models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop refinement synthesize Scallop code from diverse landing scenarios, distilling generalizable and verifiable symbolic knowledge; and (ii) an online pipeline, where a compact foundation-based semantic segmentation model generates probabilistic Scallop facts that are composed into semantic scene graphs for real-time deductive reasoning. This design combines the perceptual strengths of lightweight foundation models with the interpretability and verifiability of symbolic reasoning. Node attributes (e.g., flatness, area) and edge relations (adjacency, containment, proximity) are computed with geometric routines rather than learned, avoiding the data dependence and latency of train-time graph builders. The resulting Scallop program encodes landing principles (avoid water and obstacles; prefer large, flat, accessible regions) and yields calibrated safety scores with ranked Regions of Interest (ROIs) and human-readable justifications. Extensive evaluations across datasets, diverse simulation maps, and real UAV hardware show that NeuroSymLand achieves higher accuracy, stronger robustness to covariate shift, and superior efficiency compared with state-of-the-art baselines, while advancing UAV safety and reliability in emergency response, surveillance, and delivery missions."

    "summary": "Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D, a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training."
