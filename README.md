## 🚀 Motivation
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are revolutionizing AI capabilities in complex decision-making scenarios. However, their deployment raises critical safety concerns:
- **Adversarial attacks** on reasoning pipelines
- **Privacy leakage** through multi-step reasoning
- **Ethical risks** in high-stakes domains (e.g., healthcare, finance)
- **Systemic failures** in autonomous systems
This repository aims to catalog research addressing these challenges and promote safer LRM development.
